# How to Run this Project






### This Project is made using React (Frontend) and Node.js (Backend) by connecting it with PostgreSQL Database. Additionally I have added the feature of entering capatcha and OTP verification in Login form and Register form respectively. 

### Note

Please once check you accountSid, authToken in server.js. It should match with your actual accountSid, authToken given in your Twilio account (https://console.twilio.com/?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1).
