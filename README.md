# How to Run this Project






### This Project is made using React (Frontend) and Node.js (Backend) by connecting it with PostgreSQL Database. Additionally I have added the feature of entering capatcha and OTP verification in Login form and Register form respectively. 

### Important Note

In this project database used belongs CDAC authority. So it will not run on another system. You may need to change DB address to run on another system (change here "server.js"). 

### Note

Please once check you accountSid, authToken in server.js. It should match with your actual accountSid, authToken given in your Twilio account (https://console.twilio.com/?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1).
